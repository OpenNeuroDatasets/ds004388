Description
--------
This is a data set consisting of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG), electrospinography (ESG), electroneurography (ENG), and electromyography (EMG) recordings from 40 participants. There were four different recording conditions: i) resting state with eyes open, ii) mixed median nerve stimulation (arm nerve), iii) mixed tibial nerve stimulation (leg nerve), and iv) alternating mixed median or tibial nerve stimulation. For each participant, there is i) the simultaneous EEG-ESG-ENG-EMG-recording which also includes electrocardiographic and respiratory signals, ii) ESG electrode positions. For a detailed description please see the following article: XXX. This study was pre-registered on OSF: https://osf.io/sgptzt.

This data set is organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure specification. For more information on this data specification, see https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
Each participant's data are in one subdirectory (e.g., 'sub-001'), which contains the raw data in eeglab format.
Please note that the EEG channel Fz was referenced to i) the EEG reference (right mastoid, RM, channel name: Fz) and ii) the ESG reference (6th thoracic vertebra, TH6, channel name: Fz-TH6).
